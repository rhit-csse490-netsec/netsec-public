# Introduction

This lab will help you set up your developmental workspace for this class. We
will making use of the DETER testbed, a computing facility for cyber-security
research and development. On DETER, we will be able to run network security
experiments without the risk of breaking out into the real world. 

In this course, we will be developing networked security applications, which
comes with the unfortunate side effect that you will develop on your own
machine, but test and execute things on one or more remote machines. Therefore,
get ready to be comfortable with a command prompt, or actually a bunch of them
open at the same time. In what follows, I will describe one possible
developmental that you can use, but feel free to use whatever works best of you
at the end. 

# Step 1: Install WSL2 and Ubuntu-20.04 (or any other distro)

I assume that by this point in time in your studies, you are familiar with the
Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) and you have a working Linux shell on your
Windows machine. If you are not using a Windows machine, then you can skip over
this section and use any terminal emulator of your liking. 

If you do not have WSL2 installed, then please follow the instructions in
[this](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10) post and
make sure you have access to a Linux terminal window. You do not have to install
Ubuntu, you can install any distribution of your liking (Kali Linux is a good
one for penetration testing) as long as you know how to use and you are
comfortable installing software and using the shell. 

# Step 2: Install prerequisite software

Next, let's install a bunch of software that we are going to need for this
class. On your Unix/Linux terminal, run the following command:
```shell
sudo apt install -y git build-essential tmux
```
Note: Replace `apt` with your favorite package manager if you know what that is. 

# Step 3: Generate ssh keys

If you have already generated SSH keys **for your Linux machine** (i.e., from
the Linux terminal and not from GitBash), you can skip this step.

Open your Linux terminal, and issue the following command:
```shell
ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa
```
- Accept the default install location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`)
- I generally do not use a passphrase for my SSH keys, but feel free to use one
  if you so desire. 
- Verify that your keys have been generated by reading your public key using
  ```shell
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
  You should see a bunch of nonsense printed on the screen that is starting with
  `ssh-rsa`. Copy the generated line (you will probably have to right click and
  copy from the terminal, as Ctrl-c is reserved on Linux terminals). 

# Step 4: Add the SSH keys to your GitHub account

If you have already generated your SSH keys **from your Linux terminal** and
added those to your GitHub account, then you can skip this step. Otherwise,
follow the steps in this
[tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
to add the generated SSH key to your GitHub account. This will allow for
password-less access to your repositories. 
  
# Step 5: Create a private repository on GitHub

Create a private repository on GitHub that you will be using to develop the labs
in this course. Name the repository something catchy, like `sexy-daemon` or
whatever you like. Choose `python` as the default language (so that you get the
right `.gitignore` file) and then check the box that creates a REDME file in
your repository.
