# Introduction

The goal of this milestone is to first identify the topic you would like to work
on and then to collect a list of 10 academic papers that you would like to refer
to when doing your research and literature survey. In other words, you should
get yourself excited about a certain topic in network security and get motivated
to read papers and learn about this topic. Reading the papers will help you
master the topic so that you can identify gaps in the area of research and then
propose a methodology for tackling them. By the end of this milestone, you
should have convinced yourself, and your instructor, of the importance of the
topic you have selected in the realm of network security. 

This milestone is broken down into two steps: (1) you will first identify a
topic that excites you and you'd like to learn more about and (2) you will
collect a list of (at least) 10 academic papers that directly deal with your
topic.  


# Step 1: Milestone 0

In this first step, we would like to identify a topic that you feel excited
about and are motivated to become a master of. In order to do so, you must be
familiar with the current trends in research and what the people in the field of
network security are currently interested in. This will give you an idea about
what topics are considered important by the community at this time, and what
challenges need a solution. 

- Take a look at the list of conferences below. It is a list of the top
  conferences in the field of network security and computer security in general.
- Identify a general topic that you are interested in researching more. 
- Identify at least two papers that deal with the topic you are interested in,
  preferably from two different conferences. 
- Identify a potential idea that you might want to work on in this topic. This
  can be as vague as "making a better firewall" or "designing an adaptive
  network". 
- Write a short paragraph motivating why the area you selected is important and
  what are its impacts on the state of network security. 


## List of conferences

Below are links to the 2021 edition of the top conferences in systems and
network security. 

- [The Network and Distributed System Security
Symposium](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2021/)

Security](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2021/)
- [Usenix Security
Symposium](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21)
- [The IEEE Symposium on Security and
Privacy](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2021/program-compact.html)
- [ACM SIGCOMM](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/)

Defenses](https://raid2021.org/)

# Step 2: Milestone 1

After selecting your topic of interest, it is now time to start looking into
what researchers are currently doing in that area, so you can identify one or
more gaps in the current approaches and then propose a novel approach to tackle
these gaps. Reading these papers is going to help you gain a deeper
understanding of the topic you have selected. 

- For this milestone, you will need to identify at least **10 papers** that are
  relevant to you chosen area of research. 
- For each paper, write **one small paragraph** the quickly describes the paper
  and what it is attempting to do (no need to go into detail at this stage, just
  what you can gain from reading the abstract and the introduction of the
  paper). 
- Your papers must be published **in the last five years** or have a substantial
  amount of citations that make the paper foundational to the topic. 
- You might find [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com) very helpful in your quest
  related papers and determining citation counts. 

Here are a few guidelines to help you identify papers that are relevant for you
to read:
- [How to Read a
Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) by S.
Keshav
- [How to Read a Scientific
Paper](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/cs/csse494-495-496/ReadingscientificPaper.pdf)
by Drs Wollowski and Yoder. 


# Submission 

- Both milestones 0 and 1 are due on April 22 at 11:59 pm.
- Submit a **single pdf** document to
[gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/375534) that includes:
  - The topic that you have identified in Step 1.
  - The 10 papers that you have collected in step 2. 
  - A paragraph about each paper describing how it is relevant to your topic of
    choice. 

# Grading

This milestone is to be graded as Pass/Fail. To pass this assignment, you must
meet **100%** of the specifications below. Otherwise you will fail the
assignment. In that case, you will received feedback on you submission and will
have another chance of submitting again for credit.
