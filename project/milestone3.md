# Introduction

In this milestone, it is time to put everything we learned together into a
proposal to address a gap in the literature of network security. By this time,
after reading the papers, you should have built a good understand of the current
state of the art work in the topic you selected, and what might be the gaps that
you'd like to address. Your job is to convince your audience that your idea and
proposed solution deserve a chance to be executed in practice (that might be
in terms of providing you with funds, access to resources, etc.). 

# Writing the proposal

This will vary from project to project, but you will need to address the
following questions:
- What are the stages (or sequence of stages) that are to be done to complete
  your proposed solution? 
  - In other words, if you are to split your work into milestones, how would you
    do that?
- What are the means of testing each checkpoint or milestone in your proposed
  project?
- What are the evaluation metrics for your proposed solution?
  - In other words, how would you define success/failure in your project?
- If you have done any preliminary work, then clearly summarize the work and how
  it contributes to your proposal. 
- List any tools, resources, machines, infrastructure, â€¦ you'd need to
  successfully conduct your experiments

Make sure that any claims you make in your proposal are one of the two types:
1. A hypothesis: In this case the claim is unjustified yet. Make sure you
   mention a place to validate your hypothesis as part of the proposal.
2. A claim based on fact listed elsewhere (e.g., in a literature review): make
   sure you clearly cite the works that are addressing that claim.
