# Project Description

The goal of this class project is to get your feet wet with the process of
writing research proposals and mini research papers. This project is intended to
be open-ended and to allow you to explore an area of the course material that
you want to dive deeper into. 

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should have been able to perform the following
tasks:
1. Identify a topic of interest within the realm of network security.
2. Conduct a literature review around your selected topic.
3. Explore a small area of improvement within the scope of the current
   research.
4. Clearly articulate your ideas to address the identified shortcomings or areas
   of improvement within the current research.
5. Convince your reviewers (your instructor and your peers) of the merits of
   your ideas and that your approach is valid.
6. Review and evaluate your classmates work and provide constructive and
   supportive feedback.
7. [Optional] Implement a small proof-of-concept that highlights the
   effectiveness of your proposed idea. 

# Requirements

At the end of the term, you should submit a written proposal that surveys the
current research around a network security topic that interests you. Your final
proposal should contain the following sections:
- An __abstract__ that contains a short and concise description of your project.
- An __introduction__ section in which you motivate your problem and discuss its
  importance and relevance. This is also where you summarize your potential
  suggestions and contributions. One way to think about the introduction section
  is for it to be your sales pitch. You have to convince us why is your problem
  important and why we should care about.
- A __background__ section that discusses in details the necessary background to
  understand you work and your approach. This section should not contain new
  work, rather it should only contain background information.
- A __related work__ section that summarizes the main contributions of each
  paper or related papers in the field. This section typically ends with
  exposing a certain gap in the knowledge addressed by the related literature. 
- An __approach__ section that details your proposed approach to addressing the
  gap that you identified within the related work section. 
- An optional __results__ section that showcases any preliminary results you
  were able to obtain for your project.
- A __conclusion__ section where you bring all the pieces of your story together
  in a short descriptive paragraph. 


# Peer Review

A crucial part of the proposal writing process are reviews, and it would be
great if you can get exposure to both writing reviews and reading and acting
upon reviews. For that purpose, we will have two rounds of peer reviews where
each team will review at least one other team's proposal. Based on the collected
reviews, you can then revisit your proposal and address your peers' and your
instructor's comments. 

# Weekly Journals

As part of your project proposal, you should submit weekly journals that
summarizes the work you have done each week in addition to any challenges you
faced, and how you were able to, or plan to, overcome them. In other words, if I
were to read your weekly journals, I should be able to reproduce your work, go
through your thinking process, and avoid any pitfalls that might occur. 

# Milestones

This project is broken down into several milestones to make sure you stay up to
date on your work and submit a successful proposal. Please find a short
description of each milestone below:

| Milestone   | Description | Date      |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| M0          | Identify the topic you want to work on       | Week 5 |
| M1          | Submit a list of reading material        | Week 6 |
| M2          | Submit your literature review        | Week 7 |
| M3          | Proposal first draft       | Week 8  |
| M4          | Peer review of first draft       | Week 9 |
| M5          | Proposal second draft       | Week 10 |
| M6          | Peer review of second draft       | Week 10 | 
| M7          | Proposal final draft       | Finals Week |

# Grading

I will grade milestones on a Pass/Fail basis, with redo opportunities for those
that you do not pass.  Each milestone will have its own __specifications__
rubric which you must adhere to so that you can pass the milestone. You must
meet 80% of the specifications in order to obtain a satisfiable passing grade.
Please refer to the specifications on each milestone for more information.
