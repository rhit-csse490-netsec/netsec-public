> The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of
  concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards - and even then I
  have my doubts.
  <div style="text-align:right;">Eugene H. Spafford </div>


Was Professor Spafford justified in his approach? Are we doomed to working with
systems with little to no security? Is there really no way to design a secure
system?

In this course, you will have an opportunity to explore some of the exciting
research being done in the field of systems security. In the process, you will
develop considerable insights into the current state of systems security by
reading and presenting multiple research papers. You may or may not become a
researcher, but you may some day have to make a decision about the security of a
system that you have built or designed. This course will help give you the
foundation to make those decisions wisely.

## Prerequisites
None, we will cover everything during our discussion time.

## Course Location
TBA.

## Grading

| Item                  | Weight |
| :-------------------- | :----- |
| Paper Presentation    | 50%    |
| Paper Reviews         | 40%    |
| Attendance            | 10%    |

## Paper Reviews

Each week, you will read and review one paper that has been previously published
in a major systems and networking security conference. I would like you to write
each review championing the paper and trying to convince me of its merit. You
should frame any criticisms as suggested improvements for the paper that might
lead to a better study/analysis/design. 

Your review needs to be at least three paragraphs long, where the first one is
summary of the paper's main contributions. The second paragraph is you arguments
for the merit of the paper, while the last paragraph is dedicated for further
improvements of shortcomings. 

## Paper Presentations

Each student will be asked to present at least one paper throughout the quarter. 



## Collaboration, Cheating and Professional Behavior

Collaboration is encouraged on reviews and presentations. 
When you collaborate, you must properly credit your collaborators and clearly
indicate the extent of the collaboration. Working out a solution as a group is
acceptable collaboration. Each individual is responsible for understanding the
entire solution.  Copying is not collaboration.  Failure to properly acknowledge
collaboration can be considered cheating.

Students are expected to behave professionally. A lack of professional behavior
in a studentâ€™s interactions within a team, with an instructor, teaching
assistants or during in-class activities can result in a penalty grade.
Depending on the nature and the egregiousness of the behavior, the penalty grade
might be a reduction in letter grade or an F in the class.
